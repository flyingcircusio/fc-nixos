    Ceph environments, mainly to simplify (slow) migration scenarios where
    multiple versions of Ceph are in use during a major upgrade.

    The main concepts managed are: different PATH variables depending on
    the system configuration as well as potentially choosing different
    subsystem implementations based on the Ceph release in use (so that the
    MONs could be running Luminous while the OSDs are still running Jewel
