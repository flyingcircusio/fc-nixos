          Expected time in seconds needed to prepare for the execution of
          maintenance activities. The value should cover typical cases where
          maintenance-enter commands have to do extra work or wait for some
          condition to be true. These commands should typically not take
          longer than 5 minutes in total which is the default here.

          If commands are expected to take longer and it's not feasible to
          pause them after 5 minutes and continue later (using TEMPFAIL), the
          preparation time can be increased as needed.

          Currently, the directory doesn't know about "preparation time" as a
          separate concept, so this value is just added to the estimated run
          time for each activity. This overestimates the actual preparation
          time if multiple activities are scheduled continuously because
          maintenance-enter commands are just run once for all runnable
          activities.

          We don't enforce it at the moment but will probably add a timeout
          for maintenance-enter commands later based on this value.
