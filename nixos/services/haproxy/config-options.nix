      # `daemon`
      Makes the process fork into background. This is the recommended mode of
      operation. It is equivalent to the command line "-D" argument. It can be
      disabled by the command line "-db" argument. This option is ignored in
      systemd mode.

  chroot = mkOption {

    description = ''
      # `chroot <jail dir>`
      Changes current directory to <jail dir> and performs a chroot() there before
      dropping privileges. This increases the security level in case an unknown
      vulnerability would be exploited, since it would make it very hard for the
      attacker to exploit the system. This only works when the process is started
      with superuser privileges. It is important to ensure that <jail_dir> is both
      empty and non-writable to anyone.

  user = mkOption {

      # `user <user name>`
      Changes the process's user ID to UID of user name <user name> from /etc/passwd.
      It is recommended that the user ID is dedicated to HAProxy or to a small set
      of similar daemons. HAProxy must be started with superuser privileges in order
      to be able to switch to another one.

      # `group <group name>`
      Changes the process's group ID to the GID of group name <group name> from
      /etc/group. It is recommended that the group ID is dedicated to HAProxy
      or to a small set of similar daemons. HAProxy must be started with a user
      belonging to this group, or with superuser privileges. Note that if haproxy
      is started from a user having supplementary groups, it will only be able to
      drop these groups if started with superuser privileges.

  maxconn = mkOption {
    default = 4096;
    type = int;
    description = ''
      # `maxconn <number>`
      Sets the maximum per-process number of concurrent connections to <number>. It
      is equivalent to the command-line argument "-n". Proxies will stop accepting
      connections when this limit is reached. The "ulimit-n" parameter is
      automatically adjusted according to this value. See also "ulimit-n". Note:
      the "select" poller cannot reliably use more than 1024 file descriptors on
      some platforms. If your platform only supports select and reports "select
      FAILED" on startup, you need to reduce maxconn until it works (slightly
      below 500 in general). If this value is not set, it will automatically be
      calculated based on the current file descriptors limit reported by the
      "ulimit -n" command, possibly reduced to a lower value if a memory limit
      is enforced, based on the buffer size, memory allocated to compression, SSL
      cache size, and use or not of SSL and the associated maxsslconn (which can
      also be automatic).

                - retry   : time between two DNS queries, when no valid response
                            have been received.
                            Default value: 1s
      <time>  : time related to the event. It follows the HAProxy time format.
