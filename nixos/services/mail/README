Mail server role
================

Settings in /etc/local/nixos/mailserver.nix
-------------------------------------------

The following options need to be set in via NixOS. The prefix for all
options is `flyingcircus.roles.mailserver`:

- domains: List of domains which form the domain part of mail addresses serviced
    by this mail server. Each domain needs a MX record pointing to mailHost.

- mailHost: Public FQDN of the mail server itself. Must match forward and
    reverse DNS (A/AAAA/PTR) of the frontend interface's IP addresses.

- smtpBind4, smtpBind6: Optional IP addresses to bind on the FE interface in
    case the FE interface has several of these.

- webmailHost: Optional host name for the web mail interfaces powered by
    Roundcube.


Configuration files in /etc/local/mail
--------------------------------------

- users.json: All local mail accounts. The most important keys:
    - name: E-mail address. Domain part must match of the domains configured in
        /etc/local/nixos/. Mandatory.
    - hashedPassword: SHA-256 hash of the login password (SMTP/IMAP). If set to
        an empty string, the password is read during runtime from the password
        file (see below). Mandatory.
    - aliases: List of additional e-mail addresses for this account. Domain part
        must match one of the configured domains as in 'name'. Optional.
    - catchAll: List of domains for which all mails are collected into this user
        account. Optional.
    - quota: Maximum mail data stored on the IMAP server. Must be a number endng
        with "M" or "G". Optional.
    - sieveScript: Fixed sieve configuration for that user. Alternatively, users
        may set their own sieve scripts via Roundcube's web UI.

    Refer to `loginAccounts` in
    https://gitlab.com/simple-nixos-mailserver/nixos-mailserver/-/blob/master/default.nix
    for a full description of options.

- dns.zone: DNS settings to be copied into the relevant zone files. The DKIM key
    is already the correct one. Users with advanced feedback loop requirements
    may configure more elaborate DMARC policies. DMARC report handling
    infrastructure is currently left to the user.

- local_valiases.json: Additional virtual aliases. Equivalent to setting
    `aliases` entries in `users.json`. Target domains must be configured
    locally.

- remote_valiases.map: Arbitrary virtual aliases in postmap format. No
    restrictions apply to targets. See
    http://www.postfix.org/VIRTUAL_README.html for details.

- main.cf: Additional configuration statements to be appended to
    /etc/postfix/main.cf. See postconf(5) for a full list of options.


Password file
-------------

The mail server role allows users to set their own password if the Roundcube web
UI is enabled (set webmailHost). To make this happen, passwords must not be
statically set in users.json but dynamically in `/var/lib/dovecot/passwd`.

To set an initial password, run:

    echo "USER@DOMAIN:$(mkpasswd -m SHA-256 PASSWORD)" >> /var/lib/dovecot/passwd
