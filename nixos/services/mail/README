Mailserver role
===============

This role installs a complete mail server for incoming and outgoing mail.
Incoming mail is either delivered to IMAP mailboxes, or forwarded to an application via alias/transport configs.
It uses Postfix for mail delivery, Dovecot as IMAP access server, and Roundcube as optional web frontend.

Refer to the platform documentation for detailed information on how to configure this:

https://doc.flyingcircus.io/roles/fc-20.09-production/mailserver.html


Role Settings
-------------

The role is configured by a file named `config.json` in this directory or
via NixOS options in a module in /etc/local/nixos.

You can find a JSON config example in `config.json.example`.
Prefix options with `flyingcircus.roles.mailserver` if using NixOS config.

- domains: List of domains which form the domain part of mail addresses serviced
    by this mail server. Each domain needs a MX record pointing to mailHost.

- mailHost: Public FQDN of the mail server itself. Must match forward and
    reverse DNS (A/AAAA/PTR) of the frontend interface's IP addresses.

- smtpBind4, smtpBind6: Optional IP addresses to bind on the FE interface in
    case the FE interface has several of these.

- webmailHost: Setting the host name here enables the web mail interface powered by
    Roundcube.


Managing Users
--------------

User accounts are created by configuring them in `users.json`.
See `users.json.example` for an example.

Crypted passwords can be set directly in the config file.

It's also possible for users to set their own password if the Roundcube web
UI is enabled (set webmailHost).
To make this happen, leave the `hashedPassword` empty in `users.json` and set an
initial password in `/var/lib/dovecot/passwd` instead.

Entries in the passwd file look like this:

user1@test.fcio.net:$5$NwBmrzj2vPlIdoa0$Go0zrVY5ZQncFXlCAxA.Gqj.e4Ym6Ic242O6Mj3BK1

The password string can be created with `mkpasswd -m SHA-256`.


Further Configuration Files
---------------------------

- dns.zone: Copy-and-paste DNS records for inclusion in zone files.
- local_valiases.json: Additional aliases which are not mentioned in users.json.
- main.cf: Additional Postfix postconf(5) settings.
