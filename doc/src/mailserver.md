.. _nixos-mailserver:

Mail server
===========

This role installs a complete mail server for incoming and outgoing mail.
Incoming mail is either delivered to IMAP mailboxes via dovecot, or forwarded to
an application via alias/transport configs. Outgoing mail is accepted on the
submission port or via a *sendmail* executable.

An optional web mail UI is included. This role also includes state-of-the-art
spam control.

User accounts can be created/modified dynamically. There is, however, no default
mechanism for user management besides text files.

Which components are included?
------------------------------

The main ingredients of this role are Postfix_ for mail delivery, Dovecot_ as
IMAP access server, and Roundcube_ as web frontend. We rely mainly on rspamd_
for spam protection. To get outgoing mails delivered, they are signed with
OpenDKIM_ and a basic SPF_ and SRS_ setup is included. Additionally, a
Thunderbird-compatible client autoconfiguration_ XML file is provided which
helps many clients to configure themselves properly.

.. _nixos-mailserver-basic-setup:

How do I perform a basic setup?
-------------------------------

First, you need public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for your mail server's frontend
interface. Contact :ref:`support` if you don't have. Then, pick a mail host name
which will be advertised as MX name on your mail domain. This host name (called
**mailHost** from here on) must resolve to the FE addresses with both forward
and reverse lookups.

Additionally, some mail providers (namely [Telekom/T-Online](https://postmaster.t-online.de/#t4.1))
may require that your mailserver has an imprint served at its hostname.

For this you can either set imprintUrl to the location of your existing imprint,
or use imprintText to specify an imprint in HTML format

Note that it is not possible to set both imprintUrl and imprintText and imprint cannot be used if you serve webmail under the mailHost (meaning mailHost and webmailHost cannot be the same)

.. warning::

  Incorrect DNS setup is the most frequent source of delivery problems. Let our
  :ref:`support` check your setup if in doubt.

Create a configuration file :file:`/etc/local/mail/config.json` which contains
all the basic pieces. In the following example, the server's mailHost is
*mail.test.fcio.net* and it serves as MX for the mail domains *test.fcio.net*
and *test2.fcio.net*::

  {
    "mailHost": "mail.test.fcio.net",
    "webmailHost": "webmail.test.fcio.net",
    "domains": {
      "test.fcio.net": {
        "primary": true
      },
      "test2.fcio.net": {
        "autoconfig": false
      }
    },
    "imprintUrl": "your-company.tld/imprint"
  }

.. note::

  There must always be exactly one domain with the primary option set.

This sets up autoconfiguration_ for mail clients that wish to use *test.fcio.net*.
Autoconfiguration is disabled for *test2.fcio.net* in the example.

Run :command:`sudo fc-manage -b` to have everything configured on the system.

Afterwards, a generated file :file:`/etc/local/mail/dns.zone` contains all
necessary DNS settings for your mail server. Insert the records found in this
file into the appropriate DNS zones and don't forget to check reverses.


How do I create users?
----------------------

Edit :file:`/etc/local/mail/users.json` to add user accounts. Example::

  {
    "user1@test.fcio.net": {
      "aliases": ["first.last@test.fcio.net"],
      "hashedPassword": "$5$NTTg86onSoM1MK$Xir/pTc9G/TLM1LResKlyAip1oO9XcsmUKXaf7ALIS2",
      "quota": "4G",
      "sieveScript": null
    }
  }

This file contains of key/value pairs where the key is the main email address
and the value is a attribute set of configuration options. Domain
parts of all e-mail addresses must be listed in the `domains` option in
:file:`/etc/local/mail/config.json`.

The password must be hashed with :command:`mkpasswd -m sha-256 {PASSWORD}`.


How do mail users log into the mail server?
-------------------------------------------

* Username: full e-mail address
* Incoming: IMAP with STARTTLS, mailHost port 143
* Outgoing: SMTP with STARTTLS, mailHost port 587.

If the *webmailHost* option is defined, users can log into the web frontend with
their full e-mail address and password.


How to change passwords
-----------------------

We support two scenarios: static passwords and dynamic passwords.

Static passwords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Passwords are set by the administrator and put into users.json. They cannot be
changed by users.

Dynamic passwords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable users to change their password themselves, leave the
**hashedPassword** option in :file:`/etc/local/mail/users.json` empty and set
the initial password in :file:`/var/lib/dovecot/passwd` instead. This file
consists of a e-mail address/password pair per user. Example::

  user1@test.fcio.net:$5$NwBmrzj2vPlIdoa0$Go0zrVY5ZQncFXlCAxA.Gqj.e4Ym6Ic242O6Mj3BK1

The initial password hash can be created with :command:`mkpasswd -m sha-256
{PASSWORD}` as shown above. Afterwards, user can log into the Roundcube web mail
frontend and change their password in the settings menu.


The spam filter misclassifies mails. What to do?
------------------------------------------------

rspamd has a good set of defaults but is not perfect. To get be results, it must
receive training.

False positive (ham classified as spam)
  Move that e-mail message from the `Junk` folder back into the `INBOX` folder.

False negative (spam classified as ham)
  Move that e-mail message from the `INBOX` folder into the `Junk` folder.

In both cases, the spam filter's statistics module will be automatically
trained. Note that the spam filter needs a certain amount of training material
to become effective. This means that training effects will show up after time
and not immediately.

.. _mail-into-backends:


How do I forward mails to remote addresses?
-------------------------------------------

Declare a `virtual alias`_ map and create remote aliases there. Add the
following snippet to config.json::

  "dynamicMaps": {
    "virtual_alias_maps": ["/etc/local/mail/virtual_aliases"]
  }

Create :file:`/etc/local/mail/virtual_aliases`. Example contents::

  alias@test.fcio.net remote@address

Invoke :command:`sudo systemctl reload postfix` to recompile maps after map
contents has been changed. Invoke :command:`sudo fc-manage --build` as usual if
the contents of config.json has been changed.

.. _virtual alias: http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#virtual_alias_maps


How do I feed mails into an application?
----------------------------------------

Feeding mails destined to special accounts into backend application servers can
be done with a transport_ map. Transport and other Postfix lookup tables are
declared inside a `dynamicMaps` key in config.json. The application should open a
port capable of speaking SMTP on its srv interface. Example::

  "dynamicMaps": {
    "transport_maps": [ "/etc/local/mail/transport" ]
  }

Example transport file contents::

  specialaddress@test.fcio.net relay:172.30.40.50:8025

In case a whole subdomain should be piped into an application server, we need
both a transport and a relay_domains_ map. Both map declarations may point to
the same source as *relay_domains* uses only the first field of each line.

Example config.json snippet::

  dynamicMaps": {
    "transport_maps": [ "/etc/local/mail/transport" ],
    "relay_domains": [ "/etc/local/mail/transport" ]
  }

Example transport file contents::

  subdomain.test.fcio.net relay:172.30.40.50:8025

An DNS MX record for that subdomain must be present as well.

Invoke :command:`sudo systemctl reload postfix` to recompile maps after map
contents has been changed. Invoke :command:`sudo fc-manage --build` as usual if
the contents of config.json has been changed.

Reference
---------

DNS Glossary
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some important terminology for understanding DNS issues:

HELO name
  The canonical name of the mail server. The HELO name is the same as the value
  of the **mailHost** option and the **myhostname** Postfix configuration
  variable. The HELO name must be listed in the **MX** records of
  all served *mail domains*.

  Example: mail.test.fcio.net

Frontend IP addresses
  Public IPv4 and/or IPv6 adresses. **A** and **AAAA** queries of the HELO name
  must resolve to the frontend IP addresses. Each address must have a **PTR**
  record which must resolve exactly to the HELO name.

  Example: 195.62.126.119, 2a02:248:101:62::1191

Mail domain
  List of DNS domains that serve as domain part in mail addresses hosted by a
  mail server. Not to be confused with the domain part of the server's FQDN
  which may be the same or may not.  Each *domain* must have a **MX** record
  which points to the mail server's *HELO name*.

  Example: test.fcio.net, test2.fcio.net


Role options
~~~~~~~~~~~~

All options can be set in :file:`/etc/local/mail/config.json`
or in :ref:`Nix config <nixos-custom-modules>` with the prefix *flyingcircus.roles.mailserver*.

Frequently used options:

domains (attribute set (object) or list)
  *mail domains* which should be served by this mail server.
  Keys of the set are the domains, values are options for a specific domain.
  You can find these options below. See :ref:`nixos-mailserver-basic-setup`
  for a working example.

  The option still supports a list of strings instead of a attribute set (object).
  Using a list is deprecated and should be migrated to the attribute set form.

domains.<domain>.enable (boolean, default true)
  Enable or disable a domain.

domains.<domain>.autoconfig (boolean, default true)
  Autoconfiguration_ for mail clients is enabled by default.
  A DNS entry must exist for *autoconfig.<domain>*.
  Sets up a SSL certificate automatically using Let's Encrypt.

domains.<domain>.primary (boolean)
  Make this the primary domain for internal services (bounce emails, etc).

mailHost
  *HELO name*, see above.

webmailHost
  Virtual server name for the Roundcube web mail service. Appropriate DNS
  entries are expected to point to the VM's frontend address. If this option is
  set, the Roundcube service will be enabled.

rootAlias
  E-mail address to receive all mails to the local root account.

dynamicMaps
  Hash map of Postfix maps (like transport_) and one or more file paths
  containing map records. See section :ref:`mail-into-backends` for details.

.. _transport: http://www.postfix.org/transport.5.html

Specialist options:

redisDatabase
  Database number (0-15) for rspamd. Defaults to 5. The database number can
  be adjusted if any another local application happens to use DB 5.

smtpBind4 and smtpBind6
  Which frontend address to use in case ethfe has several of them.

explicitSmtpBind
  Whether to include explicit smtp_bind_address in the Postfix main.cf file.
  Defaults to true if ethfe has more than one IPv4 or IPv6 address. Needs
  to be overridden only in very special cases.

passwdFile
  Virtual mail users listing in :manpage:`passwd(7)` format. Set this if an
  application generates this file automatically and puts it into an
  application-specific location.


User options
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Keys that can be set per user in :file:`/etc/local/mail/users.json`.

aliases
  List of alternative e-mail addresses that will be delivered into this
  mailbox. Note that domain parts of all aliases must be listed in the *domains*
  option.

catchAll
  List of subdomains for which all incoming mails, regardless of their local
  parts, will be delivered into this mailbox. All subdomains must be listed in
  the *domains* option.

hashedPassword
  Either a salted SHA-256 password hash (for static passwords) or empty string.
  In the latter case, the password is read from :file:`/var/lib/dovecot/passwd`.

quota
  Mailbox space limit like "512M" or "2G".

sieveScript
  Mail processing rules in the Sieve_ language. Users can set dynamic sieve
  scripts from the Roundcube web UI if left empty.

.. _Sieve: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_(mail_filtering_language)


Further configuration files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

/etc/local/mail/local_valiases.json
  Additional aliases which are not mentioned in users.json. Expected to be a
  dict with the alias as key and the receiving address as value.

/etc/local/mail/main.cf
  Additional Postfix :manpage:`postconf(5)` settings.

/etc/local/mail/dns.zone
  Copy-and-paste DNS records for inclusion in zone files. Adapt if necessary.


Monitoring
