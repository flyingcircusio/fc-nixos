# Memcached

This role installs the [Memcached](https://memcached.org) memory object caching
system in the latest version provided by NixOS.

## Configuration

Out of the box, Memcached is set up with a couple of common default
parameters and listens on *localhost* and the IP-addresses of the
*ethsrv*-interface of your VM (See {ref}`networking` for details on this topic).

If you need to change the behaviour of Memcached, you have to put the
changed options into a JSON file and save it
to {file}`/etc/local/memcached/memcached.json`.

For further information on how to activate changes on our NixOS-environment,
please consult section {ref}`nixos-local`.

Supported options are:

- **port**: The port memcached should listen on. Default: 11211
- **maxMemory**: The maximum amount of memory to use for storage in MB.
  Default: 64
- **maxConnections**: The maximum amount of simultaneous connections. Default: 1024
- **extraOptions**: A string containing any additional command line options you
  like Memcached to be started with. For reference consult Memcached's man page.

So a basic non-default configuration might look like:

```
{
  "port": "11211",
  "maxMemory": "256",
  "maxConnections": "2048"
}
```
