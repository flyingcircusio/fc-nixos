.. _nixos-redis:

Redis
=====

This role installs the `Redis <https://redis.io>`_ in-memory data structure store
in the latest version provided by NixOS.

Components
----------

* Redis

Configuration
-------------

Out of the box, Redis is set up with a couple of common default
parameters and listens on the IP-addresses of the *loopback* (localhost) and
*ethsrv*-interfaces of your VM on port 6379 (See :ref:`networking`
for details on this topic).

In previous versions, custom redis configuration could be set
via :file:`/etc/local/redis/custom.conf` which is not supported anymore.

If you need to change the behaviour of Redis, you define your redis
configuration with the NixOS option ``services.redis.settings``. See the
NixOS manual for further information.

Regarding setting the redis password, see the section on redis `passwords <#password>`_.

The following NixOS module adds some modules to be loaded by Redis:

.. code-block:: nix

    # /etc/local/nixos/redis.nix
    { ... }:
    {
        services.redis.settings = {
            loadmodule = [ "/path/to/my_module.so" "/path/to/other_module.so" ];
        };
    }

See :ref:`nixos-custom-modules` for general information about writing custom NixOS
modules in :file:`/etc/local/nixos`.

There are also some options under ``flyingcircus.services.redis``, namely
``maxmemory``, ``maxmemory-policy``, ``password`` and ``listenAddresses``.

The following NixOS module sets the listening addresses to ``203.0.113.54`` and
``203.0.113.57`` as well as overriding the password to ``foobarpass``. The maximum
memory size is set to ``512mb``. The exact behavior Redis follows when the maxmemory
limit is reached is configured using the ``maxmemory-policy`` configuration directive
and is set to ``noeviction`` in this example. Read more at `redis topic lru cache <https://redis.io/topics/lru-cache>`.

.. code-block:: nix

    # /etc/local/nixos/redis.nix
    { ... }:
    {
        flyingcircus.services.redis = {
            listenAddresses = [ "203.0.113.54", "203.0.113.57 "];
            password = "foobarpass"; # Makes the password world readable, see paragraphs below for information
            maxmemory = "512mb";
            maxmemory-policy = "noeviction";
        };
    }

As an alternative to setting the ``maxmemory`` by hand you can set a ``memoryPercentage``
option. This will set the memory limit to a percentage of the total memory of the
system.

.. code-block:: nix

    # /etc/local/nixos/redis.nix
    { ... }:
    {
        flyingcircus.services.redis = {
            memoryPercentage = "50";
        };
    }

For further information on how to activate changes on our NixOS-environment,
please consult :ref:`nixos-local`.

Password
--------

The authentication password is automatically generated upon installation
and can be read *and changed* by service users. It can be found in
:file:`/etc/local/redis/password`.

It can also be specified in the
``flyingcircus.services.redis.password`` option where the password
will have a higher priority than the one in the filesystem. Setting
the ``password`` option makes the password world-readable to processes
on the VM since it will be stored in the nix store.

Overriding the ``password`` to ``foobarpass`` looks like this:

.. code-block:: nix

    # /etc/local/nixos/redis.nix
    { ... }:
    {
        flyingcircus.services.redis = {
            password = "foobarpass"; # Makes the password world readable
        };
    }


Interaction
-----------

Service users may invoke :command:`sudo fc-manage --build` to apply
service configuration changes and trigger service restarts (if necessary).

Monitoring
----------

The default monitoring setup checks that the Redis server is running
and is responding to `PING <https://redis.io/commands/ping>`_.
