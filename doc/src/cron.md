Cron
====

NixOS generally uses `systemd` which provides "Timers" as a replacement for
cron. However, for your convenience, regular cron is available on NixOS
machines.

.. note:: User crontabs are not managed within the NixOS
    configuration model: there is no versioning and no atomic loading.
    Use systemd timers instead, if you can.

Installing user crontabs
------------------------

You can edit a user's crontab with the regular :command:`crontab` command. See
:manpage:`crontab(1)` for details.

Environment
-----------

Cron jobs are executed with a rather minimal environment. The default is
something like:

.. code-block:: sh

   HOME=/home/user
   LOGNAME=user
   PATH=/run/wrappers/bin:/nix/var/nix/profiles/default/bin:/run/current-system/sw/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
   SHELL=/bin/sh
   USER=user

Often, this set of environment variables is not sufficient. To get a full
environment similar to the one present in interactive sessions, prefix your
cronjob with `source /etc/profile;`, e.g.::

    * * * * * source /etc/profile; complicated_command

There is also the possibility to set custom environment variables at the top of
a user crontab. See :manpage:`crontab(5)` for details.

We advise strongly to include a line like

.. code-block:: sh

   MAILTO=mail@address

into the top section to get error mails delivered to an address where they are
actually read and acted upon.
