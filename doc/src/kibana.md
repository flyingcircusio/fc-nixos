# Kibana

[Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana) is a data analysis tool based on
Elasticsearch. There's a role for each supported major version, currently:

- kibana6: 6.8.21
- kibana7: 7.10.2

We provide {ref}`nixos-elasticsearch` as a separate component. You need at least
one VM with an Elasticsearch role matching the version of the Kibana role. Both
can be activated on the same VM which is the easiest way to run Kibana.

We use the free versions of Kibana, which are published under the Apache 2.0
license. Elastic doesn't provide updates to the 7.x line anymore so 7.10.2 will
be the last available version. We are planning to move to OpenSearch Dashboards
instead which is a fork of Kibana 7.10.2.

## Configuration

Then Elasticsearch node Kibana connects to can be set by putting the URL
in a file {file}`/etc/local/kibana/elasticSearchUrl`.

If no URL has been set and Elasticsearch is running on the same machine,
the local node is used automatically.

To activate changes to the URL run {command}`sudo fc-manage --build`
(see {ref}`nixos-local` for details).
