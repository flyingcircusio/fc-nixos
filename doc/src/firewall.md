# Firewall

On NixOS, our general firewall rules apply with a slight deviation:
access is limited by default and can be enabled on a per-case basis.

You are free to open any port you like on the frontend network (`ethfe`) which
will be accessible to the outside world. The server-to-server network is only
accessible in a limited way from the outside and freely to the machines
in the same project.

## Adding custom configuration

To add firewall rules, you can place configuration files in
{file}`/etc/local/firewall/*`. Upon the next config activation all files placed
there will be concatenated and placed in a late stage of the firewall
configuration.

The files are shell scripts and are intended to be very simple. We check
that all lines are either:

- comments (starting with #)
- invocations of an iptables command (iptables, ip6tables, ip46tables)

After making changes to the firewall configuration, either wait for the
agent to apply it or run `sudo fc-manage -b`.

:::{note}
Use IP addresses in firewall rules. Using host names is not reliable and
unsupported.

## Firewall chains

Use only the firewall chains mentioned below for custom rules. The built-in
chains like `INPUT` are reserved for system use.

### Matching rules

nixos-fw

: Standard firewall chain for subnet and port blocks.

nixos-nat-pre

: Chain for pre-routing actions like port redirects.

nixos-nat-post

: Chain for post-routing actions like masquerading.

### Jump targets

nixos-fw-accept

: Accept traffic destined to local host.

nixos-fw-refuse

: Deny traffic by replying with a ICMP unreachable message.

nixos-fw-log-refuse

: Deny traffic by replying with a ICMP unreachable message and log denied
  packets to the journal. Log rate limits apply.

nixos-fw-drop

: Throw away traffic without notifying the sender. Not recommended since this
  is hard to debug.

## Examples

Accept TCP traffic on ethfe to port 32542:

```bash
ip46tables -A nixos-fw -p tcp -i ethfe --dport 32542 -j nixos-fw-accept
```

Refuse UDP traffic on ethsrv to port 2222:

```bash
ip46tables -A nixos-fw -p udp -i ethsrv --dport 2222 -j nixos-fw-refuse
```

Refuse traffic from specific subnet (with logging):

```bash
ip6tables -A nixos-fw -s 2001:db8:33::/48 -j nixos-fw-log-refuse
```

Masquerade outgoing traffic on ethsrv:

```bash
iptables -t nat -A nixos-nat-post -o ethsrv -j MASQUERADE
```

Divert incoming traffic on ethfe port 22 to a different port:

```bash
ip46tables -t nat -A nixos-nat-pre -i ethfe -p tcp --dport 22 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 2222
```

## How to verify

Service users may list currently active firewall rules with {command}`sudo
iptables -L`, e.g.:

```bash
iptables -L -nv    # show IPv4 firewall rules w/o DNS resolution
ip6tables -L -nv   # show IPv6 firewall rules w/o DNS resolution
```

If the intended rules do not show up, check the system journal for possible
syntax errors in {file}`/etc/local/firewall` and re-run {command}`fc-manage -b`.
